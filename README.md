# FS Investments Code Challenge

## Summary

Write code that consumes a YAML file, increments any embedded version
numbers in a variety of ways, and outputs the changed file.

You may use any language, libraries or tools you want, as long as you will be
able to demonstrate your solution in person. Code that you can email to the
interviewers ahead of time usually works best, but other means of
demonstration, such as a laptop with the necessary tools loaded, would be fine
as well.

## Input Specification

YAML file; see included "example.yaml"

Note: Don't rely on the specific structure of the included example, be
prepared to auto-detect version strings or take YAML key names/patterns
as an argument.

## Output Specification

Generate a YAML file that is the same as the input
except with version numbers changed. Include provisions for how to
increment the version numbers (major, minor, release, filtering by key
name, etc.).
